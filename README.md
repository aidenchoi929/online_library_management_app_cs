# online_library_management_app_cs
A library app designed to support two users, item borrower and system administrator for better usability through object oriented programming(OOP)
  
  The Online Library Management App is a Python-based application designed to manage a digital library, providing functionality for both borrowers and system administrators. The system supports core library operations such as borrowing and returning books, managing borrower profiles, searching the library, and handling late fees. It also enables administrators to manage library items, oversee borrower activities, and export the borrower database in CSV format.

Key Features:
  - Borrower Functionality: Borrowers can manage their profiles, search the library, borrow and return items, and track late charges. The system ensures that users can only borrow if their late charges are cleared and they meet the borrowing limits.
  - Administrator Functionality: Administrators can add or delete library items, manage borrower accounts, and oversee the library's operational data. This includes exporting borrower information to a CSV file.
  - Data Structures: The system uses efficient algorithms to manage library items and borrowers. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is employed to handle library items, enabling fast search, insertion, and deletion operations, while a Doubly Linked List (DLL) manages borrowers, supporting efficient traversal and modification.
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The app follows OOP principles with clear inheritance structuresâ€”classes like User, Borrower, Administrator, and Library are designed with encapsulation and modularity.
  - SOLID Principles: The project adheres to SOLID programming principles to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and flexible system.
This app showcases advanced data structure usage and OOP design, making it a robust solution for managing library operations digitally.
